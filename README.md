# Promotion Prediction for Employee Career Progression
## Project Overview:
The client, a large multinational corporation (MNC) with 9 broad business verticals, aims to optimize its employee promotion process for managerial roles and below. Currently, promotions are based on employee recommendations, training program evaluations, and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) completion rates. However, the final promotion decisions are delayed until after the entire evaluation process, causing disruptions in transition to new roles.
To address this, the goal of this project is to predict early whether a potential promotee will be promoted, using their historical, demographic, and performance-related attributes. Early identification of eligible employees will help the organization plan better, speed up transitions, and minimize operational delays.
## Problem Statement:
Develop a machine learning model that predicts whether an employee will be promoted or not at a given checkpoint, based on available employee data.
## Project Steps:
Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Handle missing values
Encode categorical variables
Scale numerical variables (if necessary)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Understand the distribution of promotions
Analyze feature impact on promotions
Model Development
Train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
Address class imbalance if needed
Model Evaluation
Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
